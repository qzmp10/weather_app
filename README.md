# weather_app
This project is part of The Odin Project Curriculum
-----------------
The goal of this project was to apply the knowledge gathered on JSON, Asynchronous code, promises, async & await functions & API's.

How this weather app works is very simple: it takes a location input and returns some of the current weather parameters of that location.

To get the weather data needed for this project, I interacted with the OpenWeather API, and their Geocoding API. I did not hide my API keys for this project as it was mostly created as a learning experience.
